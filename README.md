# SQLSn3k
Pronounced: *sequel-snek*

**An Alternative SQLite3 REPL written in Python**

## About
SQLSn3k is an alternative SQLite3 REPL/shell written in Python. It was made because I got really frustrated/annoyed with the default `sqlite3` REPL and its lack of features. 

### Features
* Indicator for the currently opened database
* Adds support for the `home`, `end`, and arrow keys; along with emacs-like cursor movement!
* History

### Dependencies
It only depends on packages in the standard library.

`argparse, command_parser, os, readline, shutil, sqlite3, sys`
